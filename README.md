This project is a film information webpage for 'John Wick: Chapter 4', built entirely with HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a visually engaging, informative, and user-friendly webpage featuring film synopsis, cast details, reviews, and streaming availability. The design focuses on a cinematic dark theme, responsive layout, and modern typography. The site uses semantic HTML structure, CSS Grid, and Flexbox for layout. It serves as a front-end demonstration of movie-themed web design
